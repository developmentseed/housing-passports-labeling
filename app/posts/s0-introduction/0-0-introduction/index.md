This guide describes how to label street view images with building properties and parts. It focuses on how to find and label feature that are relevant when assessing a building's resiliency.

The features we want to label are all listed in the left navigation pane. There is a description and example images for each. They labeling is roughly broken up into building properties (material, completeness, vintage, etc.) and building parts (windows, doors, garages, etc.).

## Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT)
We're using the CVAT labeling platform to perform the annotations. The CVAT tools have extensively documented the annotation process. See their tool's [readme guide]() or their [youtube video]().
