This labeling guide outlines the process of finding and labeling feature that are relevant when assessing a building's resiliency. 
The classes for labeling are categorized into two groups: building properties and building parts, which are further subdivided into different clases that have been adjusted according to the city were the projects was run.

To have a better overview of the classes and cities we worked on, you can take a look at the [summary of labeled classes](http://localhost:3000/overview/summary-of-labeled-classes/) page. Aditionally, in the left navigation panel, there is a description and example images for each class by city.
