This labeling guide outlines the process of finding and labeling feature that are relevant when assessing a building's resiliency. 

The process of generating training data involved labeling street view images using the CVAT tool. The classes for labeling were divided into two main groups: building properties and building parts, which are further subdivided into different classes that have been adjusted according to the city where the project was executed. Additionally, there were some tasks of rooftop mapping on satellite/drone images using the JOSM tool.

To have a better overview of the classes and cities we worked on, you can take a look at the [summary of labeled classes](https://devseed.com/housing-passports-labeling/overview/summary-of-labeled-classes/) page. Aditionally, in the left navigation panel, there is a description and example images for each class by city.
