This labeling guide outlines the process of finding and labeling feature that are relevant when assessing a building's resiliency. The clases for labeling are categorized into two groups: building properties and building parts, each of which has different classes that are listed in the left navigation panel. For each class, there is a description and example images by city. 

The labeling is roughly broken up into building properties (material, completeness, vintage, etc.) and building parts (windows, doors, garages, etc.).
