Rooftops in ‘Fair' condition are those that don’t appear to be new, can show some wear and tear (aging) but still look strong and not damaged.

**Tip:**

- If the concrete roof has lots of debris/construction material but doesn’t actually have walls built, label it concrete – fair.
- An example of a fair rooftop, is one that show signs of minimal rust, no holes and only minor patching.
