Rooftops in ‘Poor’ condition are those that appear to be precarious, dilapidated, poorly constructed. Often rooftops in this category have metal sheets placed on top but not securely tied down, objects to hold down the roof, gaps or holes, or signs extensive patching.

**Tips:**

- When the rooftops are located on the hills and small, label it poor.
- Whenever you see metal rooftops with things like tires other heavy objects being placed on top of the roof to keep it from moving label it poor.
