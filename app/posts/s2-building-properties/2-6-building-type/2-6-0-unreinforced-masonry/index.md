This type can be identified in an unfinished construction or exposed wall material. So the unreinforced masonry type is when the building construction hasn't concrete columns and beams.

Bear in mind:
- If the building material is adobe, the construction type is unreinforced masonry.
- If the building material is stone and the construction hasn't concrete columns and beams, then this building should be considered as unreinforced masonry.
