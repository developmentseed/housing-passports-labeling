The confined masonry & concrete frame type is when the building construction has concrete columns and beams.

In some cases, it is hard to recognize confined masonry and concrete frame construction on an image that has a finished wall or painted building. So in this case, these buildings will fall into this type.

Bear in mind:
- If the building material is stone and the construction has concrete columns and beams, then this building should be considered as reinforced masonry.
