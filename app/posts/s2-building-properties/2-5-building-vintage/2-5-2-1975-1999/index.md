  <ul align="justify">
    <li>Almost entirely confined masonry (brick walls with concrete columns poured in place after the brick was erected).</li>
    <li>Notable for several reasons:</li>
    <ul>
        <li type="circle">Much lower risk because of the confinement of the bricks by the concrete.</li>
        <li type="circle">On facades there are much larger openings and garages.</li>
        <li type="circle">More inventive, sometimes irregular construction.</li>
        <li type="circle">Plain facades, very often cantilevered over the street at the top of the first floor.</li>
        <li type="circle">Often seen in groups or batches within a neighborhood (where there is 1 there are more, you can often date neighborhoods or whole blocks).</li>
        <li type="circle">By far the most common in most areas.</li>
        <li type="circle">This construction started in the early 1970â€™s.</li>
      </ul>
