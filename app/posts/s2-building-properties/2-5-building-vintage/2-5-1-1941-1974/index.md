<p>
  <ul align="justify">
    <li>Some adobe but mostly some unreinforced masonry (100% brick or lightweight brick walls with light concrete slabs as floors between stories).</li>
    <li>Plain facades, usually in 1 vertical plain (not cantilevered over the street).</li>
    <li>Some Deco detailing, but taller so more recent than the oldest, still relatively plain fa√ßade, tick walls and small openings</li>
  </ul>
