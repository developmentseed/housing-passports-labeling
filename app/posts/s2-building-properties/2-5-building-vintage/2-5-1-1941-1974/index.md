<p>
  <ul align="justify">
    <li>Some adobe but mostly some unreinforced masonry (100% brick or lightweight brick walls with light concrete slabs as floors between stories).</li>
    <li>Notable for several reasons:</li>
    <ul>
        <li type="circle">Very high risk because of lack of reinforcing, even in 1 story.</li>
        <li type="circle">Often thick walls with smaller windows.</li>
        <li type="circle">Often plain, 50s and 60s designs, showing their age.</li>
        <li type="circle">Plain facades, usually in 1 vertical plain (not cantilevered over the street).</li>
        <li type="circle">Often seen in groups or batches within a neighborhood (where there is 1 there are more, you can often date neighborhoods or whole blocks).</li>
        <li type="circle">In the 50s and early 60s there were some developments, entire streets or multiple blocks with very similar houses, very repetitive. This largely stopped by the 70s.</li>
      </ul> 
  </ul>
