The building use options are:
- [Residental](../residential/)
- [Non residential](../non-residential/)
- [Mixed](../mixed/)

For our project on Padang, Indonesia, we split `non residential` class into `commercial` and `critical infrastructure`.
- [Commercial](../commercial/)
- [Critical infrastructure](../critical-infrastructure/)

**Bear in mind:**

1.- The building use category for Bogota, Cartagena, Lima, Neiva, St. Maarten, Mexico was classified on:
  - Residential
  - Mixed 
  - Non-residential

2.- The building use category for Padang was classified on:
  - Residential
  - Mixed
  - Commercial 
  - Critical infrastructure
