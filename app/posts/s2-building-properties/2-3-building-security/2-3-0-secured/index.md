Secured buildings have a protective barrier around them to keep others out.
### Examples:

### Cases when there is a fence, should we consider occluded or not?

**Consider like occluded**
- When the fence cover all the building. Some examples:

**Consider like not occluded**
- When the fence does not cover all the building and it allows us to see the building. Some examples:
